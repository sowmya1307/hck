            <p>The Sun and its family of planets formed when a cloud of dust and gas condensed 4.6 billion years ago. Several hundred million years after the Earth took form, an outer crust developed. But these surface rocks are no longer available for study: they have disappeared into the interior of our dynamic planet. 
                Our only clues to how the Earth formed come from meteorites and the Moon because both formed simultaneously with the planets.

           <h1 class="hea"> 1.Forming</h1>
           <p>
            Earth formed from a disk of gas and dust surrounding the young sun about 4.5 billion years ago. 
            Through accretion, these particles collided and stuck together, growing into planetesimals and eventually the early Earth. 
            A giant impact with a Mars-sized object is thought to have formed the Moon.

            2.Early Earth
           </h1>
           <p>
            Initially, the Earth was hot and molten, with a dense, toxic atmosphere. 
            Heavy elements like iron sank to the core, while lighter elements rose to form the mantle and crust. 
            Volcanic activity released gases that formed the early atmosphere. 
            The cooling planet eventually allowed for the formation of liquid water oceans. 
           </p>
           <h1 class="hea">3.Rise of Life</h1>
           <p>Life is thought to have originated in the oceans around 3.8 billion years ago. 
            The earliest life forms were microscopic organisms. 
            Over time, these organisms evolved, with cyanobacteria playing a key role in producing
             oxygen and altering the atmosphere.

                4.Geological and Biological Changes
            </h1>
            <p>
                Plate tectonics, driven by the Earth's internal heat, caused the continents to move and collide, forming mountains and shaping the Earth's surface. 
                Mass extinction events, like the Permian-Triassic extinction, drastically reduced biodiversity and allowed for new life forms to evolve. 
                The diversification of life led to the evolution of plants, animals, and eventually humans.

                5.Present and Future
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Earth continues to evolve, with ongoing geological activity and the influence of life. 
                Climate change is a significant factor in current and future changes to the planet. 
                The future of Earth depends on various factors, including the long-term behavior of the planet's interior and the impact of human activity.
